    description: `I'm 19 years old and born in Cardiff, blessed with the opportunity to create and build. Throughout my life, I've always had a feel for constructing ideas and wanting to forge them to reality. During the pandemic, I discovered this craftmanship in what we call Software Development. These tools in what we call languages that we use to forge whatever we want. Never in my life have I ever been intruiged by such concept, and therefore initiated my passion for it. Another passion of mine is sport. I'm an Athlete who competed for Wales on several occassions pre-pandemic. I don't play video games much anymore but could still probably beat you at any game. I'm also interested in space, psychology, neuroscience, music...the list goes on.`,
