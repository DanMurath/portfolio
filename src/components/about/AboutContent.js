            <p>
              I'm 19 years old and born in Cardiff, blessed with the opportunity
              to create and build. Throughout my life, I've always had a feel
              for constructing ideas and wanting to forge them to reality.
              During the pandemic, I discovered this craftmanship in what we
              call Software Development. These tools in what we call languages
              that we use to forge whatever we want. Never in my life have I
              ever been intruiged by such concept, and therefore initiated my
              passion for it. Another passion of mine is sport. I'm an Athlete
              who competed for Wales on several occassions pre-pandemic. I don't
              play video games much anymore but could still probably beat you at
              any game. I'm also interested in space, psychology, neuroscience,
              music...the list goes on.
